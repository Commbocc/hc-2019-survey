            <h3 class="text-secondary">The Results Are In!</h3>

            <p>In the Spring of 2019, a sample of residents from throughout the County were asked to weigh in on their satisfaction with the overall quality of life in Hillsborough County. A total of 1,400 statistically-valid responses were collected during the telephonic survey period and an additional 2,318 responses were collected as part of the alternative online questionnaire.</p>

            <p>To ensure that the survey collected responses that were reflective of Hillsborough Countyâ€™s demographically-diverse population, third-party survey professionals conducted the telephonic study. </p>

            <p>Data and insights gathered from the telephonic survey will be used as a baseline for how residents feel about Hillsborough County services and resources, as well as give the County more insight on key topics that impact the quality of life.</p>

            <h3>At a Glance</h3>

            <p>Overall, resident satisfaction with quality of life is high, with 93% expressing satisfaction. When asked whether they would personally recommend Hillsborough County to their friends, families, and acquaintances as a place to live, retire, raise children, work, vacation, or open a business, respondents overwhelmingly said "yes."</p>
